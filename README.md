# Events App â€“ Server (Node.js + Express)

This is the backend part of the **Events App**, which I've developed during my internship.  
It works together with the React Native frontend and handles all server-side logic, including reading and writing `.csv` files for event and participant data.

## Features

- RESTful API for:
  - Event listing and details
  - Participant registration, editing, and deletion
- Reads/writes data to `.csv` files (one per event)
- Serves dynamic event data from `events/` directory
- Supports file-based structure:
  - Each event has its own folder with event info and `participants.csv`
 
## Routes
#### Events:
- `GET /api/events` â†’ returns a list of all events with basic info (id, name, date).

- `GET /api/events/:id` â†’ returns detailed information about a specific event (time, place, age limits, description, logo, etc.).

- `POST /api/events` â†’ creates a new event (creates a folder with a CSV file to store event data).

#### Participants:

- `POST /api/events/:id/register` â†’ registers a new participant for the event (saves them in participants.csv).

- `GET /api/events/:id/participants` â†’ returns all participants of the event.

- `PUT /api/events/:eventId/participants/:participantId` â†’ updates participant data.

- `DELETE /api/events/:eventId/participants/:participantId` â†’ removes a participant.

#### Results:

- `POST /api/events/:id/results` â†’ saves race results for participants.

- `GET /api/events/:id/results` â†’ returns results of an event.

- `DELETE /api/events/:id/results/:date` â†’ deletes all results for a given date.
